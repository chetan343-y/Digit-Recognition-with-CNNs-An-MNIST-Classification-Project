# MNIST Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. By identifying numerical patterns, the model demonstrates CNN’s strength in image recognition tasks.

## Summary

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- The MNIST dataset is split into training and test sets.
- Each image is reshaped to include a channel dimension (28x28x1), aligning with CNN input requirements.
- Pixel values are normalized to ensure stable and efficient model training.

### 2. Model Architecture
- **a. Convolution Layer**: Extracts essential features (e.g., edges, patterns) by applying filters across the image.
- **b. Max Pooling Layer**: Reduces spatial dimensions, lowering computational costs and making the model more robust to small shifts in the images.
- **c. Fully Connected Layers**: Outputs from convolutional layers are flattened and fed into dense layers for classification, ending in a softmax layer for multi-class output (digits 0–9).

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- The model is trained with the `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function and `adam` optimizer.
- Model performance is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy is used as the primary metric.

## Why This Project

### 1. Image Recognition Task
- MNIST is a widely-used dataset for testing image recognition techniques, ideal for building and testing CNN architectures.

### 2. Understanding CNNs
- Convolutional layers capture spatial hierarchies (e.g., edges, textures) essential for analyzing image-based data. This project highlights CNN's effectiveness in processing visual information.

### 3. Benchmark in Machine Learning
- As a benchmark dataset, MNIST allows for easy comparison with other models and methods, helping gauge the effectiveness of CNN architectures.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Usage
1. Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess the images.
2. Train the CNN on the training dataset.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset.
