1.**Data Loading and Preparation:** The MNIST dataset is split into training and test sets. Each image is reshaped to include a channel dimension (28x28x1) to match CNN input requirements and normalized for more stable training.

2.**Model Architecture:**

a.**Convolution Layer:** Detects features like edges and patterns in the images by applying a set of filters (kernels) over the image.
b.**Max Pooling Layer:** Reduces the spatial dimensions, which helps in lowering computational cost and making the model invariant to small shifts.
c.**Fully Connected Layers:** Flattened outputs from the convolutional layers are fed into dense layers to perform the final classification, with a softmax layer for multi-class output (digits 0â€“9).

3.**Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained with the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer, and evaluated on the test set to determine accuracy.

**Why This Project:**

1.**Image Recognition Task:** MNIST is a classic dataset for testing basic image recognition, making it suitable for building and experimenting with a CNN.

2.**Understanding CNNs:** Convolutional layers are effective in capturing spatial hierarchies (like edges and patterns), which is why they are widely used for image data. This project illustrates the advantages of CNNs in processing image-based data.

3.**Benchmark in Machine Learning:** MNIST is a popular benchmark dataset, allowing comparison with other models and techniques to measure model performance easily.
